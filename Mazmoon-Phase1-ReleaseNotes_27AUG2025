## Known Limitations

- Font controls are functional but limited to basic formatting
- Insert, Layout, and Review ribbon tabs are placeholder implementations
- No file save/load functionality implemented yet
- Document structure limited to single-page view

## Development Status

This release represents the completion of Phase 1: GUI Framework Development. The codebase provides a stable foundation for Phase 2 implementation, which will focus on InPage 2014 compatibility layer and advanced text processing features.

## Future Roadmap
